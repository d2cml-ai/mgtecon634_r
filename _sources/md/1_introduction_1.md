# Introduction

<!-- This tutorial will introduce key concepts in machine learning-based causal inference. It’s an ongoing project and new chapters will be uploaded as we finish them. A tentative list of topics that will be covered: -->




Please note that this is currently a living document. Chapters marked as “beta” may change substantially and are in most need of feedback. If you find any issues, please feel free to contact Vitor Hadad at vitorh@stanford.edu. The “changelog” below will keep track of major updates and additions.

## Getting started

We’ll illustrate key concepts using snippets of Python code. Each chapter in this tutorial is self-contained. You can download the [repository](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/ml_ci_tutorial/tree/main/Python_tutorials). You should be able to rerun most of the code on a different dataset by editing some of the common variables at the top of the notebook (e.g., data, covariates, and outcome). Exceptions to this rule are marked as comments in the text, so please read them carefully.

## Acknowledgments

This tutorial first started as an extension of documents written in part by research assistants, students, and postdocs at the Golub Capital Social Impact Lab. We thank the authors of those documents: Kaleb K. Javier, Niall Keleher, Sylvia Klosin, Nicolaj Søndergaard Mühlbach, Xinkun Nie, and Matt Schaelling. We also thank other people who have been reading this current draft and providing “live” feedback: Cesar Augusto Lopez, Sylvia Klosin, Janelle R. Nelson, Erik Sverdrup.
