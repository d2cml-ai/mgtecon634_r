    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a setting with two samples: an Experimental ($E$) sample and an Observational ($O$)\n",
    "sample. The experimental and observational sample contain observations on $N_E$ and $N_O$ units,\n",
    "respectively. It is convenient to view the data as consisting of a single sample of size $N =\n",
    "N_E + N_O$, with $P_i \\isin \\mathrm{O, E}$ a binary indicator for the group to which unit $i$ belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $N_E$ individuals in the experimental group, there is a single binary treatment of\n",
    "interest, $Wi \\isin \\{0, 1\\}$, and a primary outcome, denoted by $Y_i$. This outcome is not observed\n",
    "for individuals in the experimental sample. However, we do measure intermediate outcomes,\n",
    "which we refer to as surrogates (to be defined precisely in Section 3.2), denoted by $S_i$ for each\n",
    "individual. Typically, the surrogate outcomes are vector-valued in order to make the properties\n",
    "we define plausible. Finally, we measure pre-treatment covariates $X_i$ for each individual. These\n",
    "variables are known not to be affected by the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the potential outcomes framework or Rubin Causal Model (Rubin 1974; Holland\n",
    "1986; Imbens and Rubin 2015), individuals in this group have two pairs of potential outcomes:\n",
    "$\\left(Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\\right)$ and $\\left(S_i(0), S_i(1)\\right)$. The realized outcomes are related to their respective potential outcomes as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_i=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}Y_i(0) & \\text { if } W_i=0, \\\\ Y_i(1) & \\text { if } W_i=1,\\end{array} \\quad\\right. \\quad \\text{and } \n",
    "S_i = \\left\\{\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}S_i(0) & \\text { if } W_i=0, \\\\ S_i(1) & \\text { if } W_i=1,\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the units are characterized by the values of the sextuple $\\left(Y_i(0), Y_i(1), S_i(0), S_i(1), X_i, W_i\\right)$.\n",
    "We do not observe the full sextuple for any units. Rather, for units in the experimental sample\n",
    "we observe only the triple $\\left(X_i, W_i, S_i\\right)$ with support $\\mathbb X, \\mathbb W = \\{0, 1\\}$, and $\\mathbb S$ respectively. In the\n",

    "We observe the triple $(X_i, S_i, Y_i)$, with support $\\mathbb X, \\mathbb S$, and $\\mathbb Y$ respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "or similar estimands, such as the average primary outcome for the treated units, or for some other\n",

    "problem in estimating $\\tau$ in the experimental group is that the outcome $Y_i$ is missing for all units in the experimental sample. To address this missing data problem, we exploit the observational\n",
    "sample and its link to the experimental sample through the presence of the surrogate outcomes\n",
    "$S_i$. Note that the surrogates, like the pre-treatment variables, are not of intrinsic interest. The\n",

    "interest only insofar as it aids in estimation of $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss three assumptions that together allow us to combine the observational\n",
    "and experimental samples and estimate the causal effect of the treatment on the primary outcome\n",
    "using a set of intermediate outcomes. The first assumption is unconfoundedness or ignorability,\n",
    "common in the program evaluation literature, which ensures that adjusting for pre-treatment\n",
    "variables leads to valid causal effects. The second assumption is the surrogacy condition, which\n",
    "we define more precisely below, and is the key condition that allows to use the surrogate variables\n",
    "to proxy for the primary outcome. The third assumption is comparability, which ensures that\n",
    "we can learn about relationships in the experimental sample from the observational sample.\n",
    "After stating these three assumptions, we present our main identification result, showing how\n",
    "the ATE on the primary outcome can be identified by combining intermediate outcomes under\n",
    "these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unconfoundedness \n",
    "\n",
    "For the individuals in the experimental group, define the propensity score as the conditional\n",
    "probability of receiving the treatment: $e(x) = \\mathrm{pr}\\left(Wi = 1 | X_i = x, P_i = E\\right)$. We assume that for individuals in the experimental group, treatment assignment is unconfounded and we have overlap in the distribution of pre-treatment variables between the treatment and control groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 1.** (Unconfounded Treatment Assignment / Strong Ignorability)\n",
    "\n",
    "$(i)\\quad W_i \\perp\\left(Y_i(0), Y_i(1), S_i(0), S_i(1)\\right) \\mid X_i, P_i=\\mathrm{E}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$(ii) \\quad 0<e(x)<1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption implies that in the experimental group, we could estimate the average causal\n",
    "effect of the treatment on the outcome $Y_i$ by adjusting for pre-treatment variables, if the $Y_i$ were measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Surrogacy and the Surrogate Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the primary outcome is not measured in the experimental group, we exploit surrogates\n",
    "to identify the treatment effect of $W$ on $Y$ . The defining property of these surrogates $S_i$ is the following condition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 2** (Surrogacy)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_i \\perp Y_i \\mid S_i, X_i, P_i = \\mathrm E.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the surrogacy condition requires that the surrogates fully capture the causal\n",
    "link between the treatment and the primary outcome. Figure 1 illustrates the content of this\n",
    "assumption using directed acyclical graphs to represent the causal chain from the treatment to\n",
    "the surrogate to the long-term outcome, as in Pearl (1995). Panel A shows a DAG where the\n",
    "surrogacy assumption is satisfied by a single intermediate outcome $S$ that lies on the causal\n",
    "chain between $W$ and $Y$ . Panel B shows an example where Assumption 2 is violated because\n",
    "there is a direct effect of the treatment on the outcome that does not pass through the surrogate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel $C$ shows our approach to addressing this problem: introducing multiple intermediate\n",
    "outcomes that together span the causal chain from $W$ to $Y$ . In this example, the three inter-\n",
    "mediate outcomes together span the causal chain from $W$ to $Y$ and hence can be combined to\n",
    "construct a surrogate index that captures long-term treatment effects. Importantly, one does\n",
    "not necessarily have to observe every intermediate outcome that lies on the causal chain between\n",
    "$W$ and $Y$ . For example, if a treatment (e.g., smaller class sizes) affects earnings by increasing\n",
    "both math and science aptitude, math scores by themselves could serve as a valid surrogate if\n",
    "math and science scores are perfectly correlated. The key requirement is that the set of inter-\n",
    "mediate outcomes together span the set of causal pathways, either because they themselves are\n",
    "the causal factors or because they are correlated with the causal factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is instructive to compare the surrogacy assumption to the exclusion restriction assumption\n",
    "familiar to economists in instrumental variables settings. Figure 1d shows a DAG representation\n",
    "of the standard instrumental variables (IV) model, where there is an unobserved confounder\n",
    "between $W$ and $Y$ . In the standard IV approach, this confound is addressed by introducing\n",
    "an instrument $Z$ that affects $W$ but does not affect $Y$ directly (the exclusion restriction). In\n",
    "the surrogacy case, we are interested in the effect of $W$ on $Y$ , where we assume there is no\n",
    "confounder between $W$ and $Y$ (or, equivalently, we find an instrument for $W$ that eliminates\n",
    "such confounds). This is analogous to the (reduced-form) effect of $Z$ on $Y$ in the IV case. The\n",
    "reduced-form effect can be estimated directly in the IV case because $Z$ and $Y$ are both observed\n",
    "in the same dataset. The problem we address here is how to estimate the effect of $Z$ (or $W$,\n",
    "assuming unconfoundedness) on $Y$ when they are not observed in the same dataset. The analog\n",
    "to the exclusion restriction here is that there is no direct effect of $W$ on $Y$ that does not run\n",
    "through $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We exploit the availability of multiple intermediate outcomes by defining two concepts: the\n",
    "surrogate index and surrogate score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deffinition 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "The surrogate Index: *The surrogate index is the conditional expectation\n",
    "of the primary outcome given the surrogate outcomes and the pre-treatment variables in the\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The surrogate index $h_0(s, x)$ is estimable because we observe the triple $\\left(Y_i, S_i, X_i\\right)$ in the observational sample. In a linear model, the surrogate index is simply a linear combination of the individual intermediate outcomes – the predicted value from a regression of the primary outcome on the intermediate outcomes.\n",

    "make is that the conditional distribution of $Y_i$ given ($S_i$, $X_i$) in the observational sample is the same as the conditional distribution of $Y_i$ given ($S_i$, $X_i$) in the experimental sample. Formally, Assumption 3. (Comparability of Samples)\n",
